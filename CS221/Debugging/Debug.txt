name of failed test:
where breakpoints:
where was bug:
how did I fix it?

1) Empty Set
	*My breakpoint was in the SetTester.java class on line 104
	which is where it calls the emptySet() method.
	*The bug was in ArraySet.java on line 39 in the return value
	of the isEmpty() method.
	*I fixed the bug by changing the return value of (rear > 0)
	to (rear <= 0)
	
2) Empty Set add a
	*MY breakpoint was in the SetTester.java class on line 140
	which is where it calls the emptySet() method.
	*The bug was in the add() method. It would add an element to
	the set, but not increase the size(rear).
	*I fixed the bug by adding the code rear++; to line 59 of
	ArraySet.java after setArray[rear] = element;
	
3) A_addB_AB_testRemoveA
	*My breakpoint was in the SetTester.java class on line 258
	which is where it calls the testRemove() method, trying to
	remove elementA.
	*The bug was in the T remove() method. There was a while loop
	on lines 73-76 that caused a indexOutOfBounds exception: 2.
	*To fix the bug, I changed the while loop and made it into a 
	for loop.
	
4) AB_remove_A_B_testContainsA
	*My breakpoint was in the SetTester.java class on line 294
	which is where is calls the testContains() method, trying to
	test and see if element_A is in the set or not.
	*The bug was in the for loop I had replace for the while loop
	in the 3rd bug in lines 73-76 that caused the elements in
	the set to be in the wrong place and thus removing the wrong
	element.
	*I fixed the bug by adding a new int j = 0 for the for-loop
	instead of using the int i which was already there. Then I
	set setArray[i] equal to setArray[j].
